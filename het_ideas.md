## angles to take on HET

- Darpa work on lost time vs EU project on brain; lancet article has TBI as 3rd most common form of disability in 2020
- The gap between research focus in advanced limbs and the commercial/industrial realities
- could just focus on deep-brain stimulation, as it has a long history, and is less 'detached,' and is like the drugs in various ways
- map the different subject-positions associated with different HETs -- an implant, a drug, a prosthetics -- all have different corporeal modalities, associated fields, etc.
- re-read the royal society doc with an eye on different between research and clinical/industry practice
- what do these devices mean in relation to current understandings of work, labour, organization, media, production, value, power, etc?
- what are the guiding models -- factory? army?
- how are they figured and narrated across various media/textual/communication forms?
